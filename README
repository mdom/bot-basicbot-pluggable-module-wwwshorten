NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::WWWShorten - Shorten all urls

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
    By loading this module your bot will check all messages for an url and
    will reply with an shortened url and its title if the url links to an
    html document. The bot will use TinyURL as default to generate a shorter
    uri but the module supports all services provided by WWW::Shorten.

     user> !load WWWShorten
     bot > Okay.
     user> http://www.heise.de
     bot > http://tinyurl.com/48z [ heise online - Home ]

VARIABLES
  user_min_length
    If this variable is set to a true value, only urls that are longer than
    "user_min_length" are processed by this module. All shorter urls are
    ignored. Default to zero (aka false).

  user_addressed
    Ignore all messages that are not directly addressed for the bot.
    Defaults to false.

  user_service
    Specifies which service to use to actually shorten all urls. Accepts the
    last part of the module name of all modules compatible with
    WWW::Shorten, for example TinyURL, TinyClick or Shorl. Defaults to
    TinyUrl.
